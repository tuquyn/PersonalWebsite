Comment:  
I have learn html/css for a while, i think that i understand it clearly but actually its not. For this exercise, i have to include Frame (instead of nav)
so its really hard to do css elements such as position, display, text-align, (also width, height, top, left :<)... I also make mistake while i have css for
the element without tag name (like i do css for all div elements when i do home page). It takes time for me to recheck it.
